# Web application for handwritten number recognition

## About Application
This application allows you to try out MNIST on the web.  
Using Support Vector Machine, we created a model to classify images of handwritten numbers and embedded it into an application built with Flask.
This made it possible for us to try out MNIST easily.

This script and the Dokcer image were deployed using Google Cloud Platform's Container Registory and Cloud Run.
